# Experiment with GitHub

This is your README. READMEs are where you can communicate what your project is and how to use it.

For my first experiment, I hope to print out the map of Uusimaa.

In addition, I hope to color each municipality of Uusimaa according to the datafile I load here.

I plan to use Voila while doing this.
